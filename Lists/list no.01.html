            <ul>
                <li>HTML pages are text documents.</li>
                <li>HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround
                    special meaning.</li>
                <li>Tags are often referred to as elements</li>
                <li>Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag
                    denotes the end.</li>
                <li>Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.</li>
                <li>Attributes require a name and a value</li>
                <li>To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they
                    can go.</li>
